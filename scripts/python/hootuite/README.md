# Overview
Hootsuite scripts are designed to work with exported hootsuite data from RFJ posts. 

# twitter_metrics.py
This script is a work in progress. The purpose of this script is to ingest exported hoostuite twitter data and assess the posts for effectiveness...Ideally, we will be able to assess the effectiveness of twitter posts utilizing the available hootsuite data points. Initially, we will use engagements and impressions as our measure of effectiveness and utilize other fields (or create our own) as the best predictors for these metrics. 

## Process
1. Provide the script with the hootsuite twitter posts csv
2. Run the script
