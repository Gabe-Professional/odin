ODIN -- Module to support Analysis of ElasticSearch Data
===================================================
This is a library of analysis tools used extensively by Odin.  Currently, this package
serves as both a python (eventually R also) Elastic Search API as well as a set of 
analysis/visualization tools useful for interacting with Pulse Elastic Search data.  

In addition to providing access to the Pulse Elastic Search database, ODIN provides a 
rich set of Command Line Interface (CLI) applications that allow for performing operations 
such as running a variety of analytics models (i.e. statistical, machine learning), parsing Elastic Search data, 
and visualizing that data.
